// Option 1: Augment the Session interface

// Here, weâ€™re extending Session.user by merging it with DefaultSession["user"] (which includes name, email, image), plus our custom fields.
// Also note, you might define the interface for the User if you want to ensure user.isSubscribed is typed there as well.
